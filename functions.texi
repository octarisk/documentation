@deftypefnx {} {} betainc_vec (@var{x}, @var{a}, @var{b}, @var{tail})
Compute the incomplete beta function ratio.

This function shadows the core function betainc. Performance improvement
due to vectorized C++. Support for single precision was removed.

This is defined as
@tex

             |
             /
            0
@end group
@end example

@end ifnottex

with @var{x} real in [0,1], @var{a} and @var{b} real and strictly positive.
If one of the input has more than one components, then the others must be
scalar or of compatible dimensions.

By default or if @var{tail} is @qcode{"lower"} the incomplete beta function
ratio integrated from 0 to @var{x} is computed. If @var{tail} is
@qcode{"upper"} then the complementary function integrated from @var{x} to
1 is calculated. The two choices are related as

betainc (@var{x}, @var{a}, @var{b}, @qcode{"lower"}) = 
1 - betainc (@var{x}, @var{a}, @var{b}, @qcode{"upper"}).

Convert a given interest rate from one compounding type, frequency and day
count convention (dcc) into another type, frequency and dcc. @*

 The following conversion formulas are applied:  (the timefactor is 
 depending on day count convention and days between valuation_date and 
valuation_date + node)). Convert
 @example
 from CONT ->   SMP:    (exp(rate_origin .* timefactor_origin) -1) ...
./ timefactor_target
 from SMP ->    CONT:   ln(1 + rate_origin .* timefactor_origin) ...
./ timefactor_target
 from DISC ->   CONT:   ln(1 + rate_origin./ comp_freq_origin) ...
.* (timefactor_origin .* comp_freq_origin) ./ timefactor_target
 from CONT ->   DISC:   (exp(rate_origin .* timefactor_origin ...
./ (comp_freq_target .* timefactor_target)) - 1 ) .* comp_freq_target
 from SMP ->    DISC:   ( (1 + rate_origin .* timefactor_origin) ...
.^(1./( comp_freq_target .* timefactor_target)) -1 ) .* comp_freq_target
 from DISC ->   SMP:    ( (1 + rate_origin ./ comp_freq_origin ) ...
.^(comp_freq_origin .* timefactor_origin) -1 ) ./ timefactor_target
 from CONT ->   CONT:   rate_origin .* timefactor_origin ./ timefactor_target 
 from SMP ->    SMP:    rate_origin .* timefactor_origin ./ timefactor_target 
 from DISC ->   DISC:   ( (1 + rate_origin ./ comp_freq_origin) ...
.^((comp_freq_origin .* timefactor_origin) ./ ( comp_freq_target ...
.* timefactor_target)) -1 ) .* comp_freq_target
 @end example
 Please note: compounding_freq is only relevant for compounding type DISCRETE. 
 Otherwise it will be neglected. During object invocation, a default
 value for compounding_freq is set, even it is not required. Example call: @*
 @example

Wrap basic functionality of Matlab's solver fmincon to Octave's sqp. @*
Non-linear constraint functions provided by fmincon's function handle 
@code{nonlincon} are NOT processed. @*
Return codes are also mapped according to fmincon expected return codes. 
Note: This function mimics the behaviour of fmincon only.@*
In order to speed up minimizing, a bounded minimization algorithm fminbnd
is used in a first try. If this fails, sqp algorithm is called.

Matlab:
@example
@group
A*x <= b
Aeq*x = beq
lb <= x <= ub
@end group
@end example
Octave: 
@example
@group
g(x) = -Aeq*x + beq = 0
h(x) = -A*x + b >= 0
lb <= x <= ub
@end group
@end example
See the following example:
@example
@group
[x obj info iter] = fmincon (@@(x)100*(x(2)-x(1)^2)^2 + (1-x(1))^2,[0.5,0],[1,2],1,[2,1],1)
x = [0.41494,0.17011]
obj =  0.34272

The standard notation is @math{P(a,x)}, e.g., @nospell{Abramowitz} and

If @var{a} is scalar, then @code{gammainc (@var{x}, @var{a})} is returned

If neither @var{x} nor @var{a} is scalar, the sizes of @var{x} and

The elements of @var{a} must be nonnegative.

By default or if @var{tail} is @qcode{"lower"} the incomplete gamma
function integrated from 0 to @var{x} is computed.  If @var{tail}
is @qcode{"upper"} then the complementary function integrated from
 @var{x} to infinity is calculated.

If @var{tail} is @qcode{"scaledlower"}, then the lower incomplete gamma
function is multiplied by
@tex
$\Gamma(a+1)\exp(x)x^{-a}$.
@end tex
@ifnottex
@math{gamma(a+1)*exp(x)/(x^a)}.
@end ifnottex
If @var{tail} is @qcode{"scaledupper"}, then the upper incomplete gamma
function is divided by the same quantity.

By default or if @var{tail} is @qcode{"lower"} the inverse of the
incomplete gamma function integrated from 0 to @var{x} is computed.
If @var{tail} is @qcode{"upper"}, then the complementary function

@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{rate}] =} getCapFloorRate (@var{CapFlag}, @var{F}, @var{X}, @var{tf}, @var{sigma}, @var{model})

Compute the forward rate of caplets or floorlets according to Black, Normal or
analytical calculation formulas.

Input and output variables:
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{CapFlag}: model (Black, Normal) [required] 
@item @var{F}: forward rate (annualized) [required] 
@item @var{X}: strike rate (annualized) [required] 
@item @var{tf}: time factor until forward start date (in days) [required] 
@item @var{sigma}: swap volatility according to tenor, term and moneyness (act/365 continuous)[required] 
@item @var{model}: model (Black, Normal, Analytical) [required]
@item @var{rate}: OUTPUT: adjusted forward rate

For Black model, the following formulas are applied:
@example
@group
Caplet_rate = (F*N( d1) - X*N( d2))
Floorlet_rate = (X*N(-d2) - F*N(-d1))
d1 = (log(F/X) + (0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*sqrt(tf))
d2 = d1 - sigma*sqrt(tf)
@end group
@end example
@*
For Normal model, the following formulas are applied:
@example
@group
Caplet_rate = (F - X) * normcdf(d)  + sigma*sqrt(tf) * normpdf(d)
Floorlet_rate = (X - F) * normcdf(-d) + sigma*sqrt(tf) * normpdf(d)
d = (F - X) / (sigma*sqrt(tf));
@end group
@end example
@*
For analytical model, the following formulas are applied:
@example
@group
Caplet_rate = max(0, F - X);
Floorlet_rate = max(0, X - F);

Return diversified volatility for synthetic basket instruments.
The diversified volatility is dependent on the option maturity and strike,
so the volatility has to be calculated for each basket option valuation.
The following two methods are implemented:
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{Levy 1992}: Levy uses a log-normal density as a first-order 
approximation to the true density. This holds for small maturities or
volatilities only, since a weighted sum of log-normal distribution is not a log-normal
distribution by itself.
@item @var{VCV approach}: Assuming a normal distribution of underlying, the
basket volatility is calculated by sigma = sqrt(w'*C*w) with Covariance Matrix C
and the linear-combinations vector w.
@item @var{Beisser}: Calculate lower limit of option prices by adjusting
input volatilities and strikes. Also returns modified strike @var{basket_dict}.

@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{forward_rate}=} get_cms_rate_hagan(@var{valuation_date}, @var{value_type}, @var{swap}, @var{curve}, @var{sigma}, @var{payment_date})

Compute the cms rate of an underlying swap floating leg incl. convexity 
adjustment. The implementation of cms convexity adjustment is based on
P.S. Hagan, Convexity Conundrums, 2003.
There is a minor issue with Hagans formulas: An adjustment to the 
value of the swaplet / caplet / floorlet is being calculated. For calculation 
of this adjustment a volatility is required. The volatility has to be 
interpolated from a given volatility cube with a given moneyness. In case of 
swaplets, the moneyness can be assumed to be 1.0. For caplets / floorlets, the 
moneyness can be calculated as (cms_rate-X) or (cms_rate/X). Here either the
adjusted cms rate or still the unadjusted cms rate can be used to calculate
the moneyness.@*
Explanation of Input Parameters:
@*

@item @var{value_type}: value type (e.g. base or stress)
@item @var{swap}: swap instrument object, underlying of cms swap

@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{score} ] =} get_informscore(@var{isocode})

Map the ISO-2 currency code to INFORM risk score.
See http://www.inform-index.org/ for further information.
Basic idea: if absolute needs (food, shelter, political stability, natural
desaster recovery) is not given, financial investments have to be closely
monitored. INFORM risk score delivers this classification in a condensed
way.

@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{r} @var{type} ] =} get_marginal_distr_pearson (@var{mu}, @var{sigma}, @var{skew}, @var{kurt}, @var{Z})

Compute a marginal distribution for given set of uniform random variables 
with given mean, standard deviation skewness and kurtosis. The mapping is 
done via the Pearson distribution family.
@*
The implementation is based on the R package 'PearsonDS: Pearson Distribution 
System' and the function 'pearsonFitM' by @*
Martin Becker and Stefan Kloessner (2013) @* 
R package version 0.97. @*
URL: http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PearsonDS @*
licensed under the GPL >= 2.0 @*
Input and output variables:
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{mu}:      mean of marginal distribution (scalar)
@item @var{sigma}:   standard deviation of marginal distribution (scalar)
@item @var{skew}:    skewness of marginal distribution (scalar)
@item @var{kurt}:    kurtosis of marginal distribution (scalar)
@item @var{Z}:       uniform distributed random variables (Nx1 vector)
@item @var{r}:       OUTPUT: Nx1 vector with random variables distributed 
according to Pearson type (vector)
@item @var{type}:    OUTPUT: Pearson distribution type (I - VII) (scalar)
@end itemize
The marginal distribution type is chosen according to the input parameters 
out of the Pearson Type I-VII distribution family: @*
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{Type 0}   = normal distribution
@item @var{Type I}   = generalization of beta distribution
@item @var{Type II}  = symmetric beta distribution
@item @var{Type III} = gamma or chi-squared distribution
@item @var{Type IV}  = special distribution, not related to any other 
distribution
@item @var{Type V}   = inverse gamma distribution
@item @var{Type VI}  = beta-prime or F distribution
@item @var{Type VII} = Student's t distribution

@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{X}] =} harrell_davis_weight (@var{scenarios}, @var{observation}, @var{alpha})

Compute the Harrell-Davis (1982) quantile estimator and jacknife standard errors of quantiles. 
The quantile estimator is a weighted linear combination or order statistics in which the order statistics used 
in traditional nonparametric quantile estimators are given the greatest weight. In small samples the H-D estimator 
is more efficient than traditional ones, and the two methods are asymptotically equivalent. 
The H-D estimator is the limit of a bootstrap average as the number of bootstrap resamples becomes infinitely large. 
@*
Variables:
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{scenarios}: number of total scenarios
@item @var{observation}: input vector for which HD weights shall be calculated
@item @var{alpha}: quantile (e.g. 0.005) 
@item @var{X}: OUTPUT: HD-weight corresponding to observation vector

@deftypefn {Function File} {[ @var{r}, @var{c} ] = } ind2sub_tril (@var{N}, @var{idx})
Convert a linear index to subscripts of a trinagular matrix.

An example of trinagular matrix linearly indexed follows

@example
         N = 4;
         A = -repmat (1:N,N,1);
         A += repmat (diagind, N,1) - A.';
         A = tril(A)
         => A =
             1    0    0    0
             2    5    0    0
             3    6    8    0
             4    7    9   10
@end example

The following example shows how to convert the linear index `6' in
the 4-by-4 matrix of the example into a subscript.

@example
         [r, c] = ind2sub_tril (4, 6)
         => r =  2
           c =  3
@end example

when @var{idx} is a row or column matrix of linear indeces then @var{r} and
@var{c} have the same shape as @var{idx}.

@deftypefn {Function File} { [@var{y}] =} interpolate_curve (@var{nodes}, @var{rates}, @var{timestep}, @var{interp_method}, @var{ufr}, @var{alpha}, @var{method_extrapolation})

Calculate an interpolated rate on a curve for a given timestep.@*
Supported methods are: linear (default), moneymarket, exponential, loglinear, 
spline, smith-wilson, monotone-convex, constant (mapped to previous),
previous and next.

A constant extrapolation is assumed, except for smith-wilson, where the 
ultimate forward rate will be reached proportional to reversion speed alpha.
For all methods except splines a fast taylormade algorithm is used. For 
splines see Octave function interp1 for more details. 
Explanation of Input Parameters of the interpolation curve function:
@*
Variables:
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{nodes}: is a 1xN vector with all timesteps of the given curve
@item @var{rates}: is MxN matrix with curve rates per timestep defined in
                     columns. Each row contains a specific scenario with 
                     different curve structure
@item @var{timestep}: is a scalar, specifiying the interpolated timestep on 
                     vector nodes
@item @var{interp_method}: OPTIONAL: interpolation method: linear (default),
						mm,exponential,loglinear,spline,
          			smith-wilson,monotone-convex,constant,next,previous
@item @var{ufr}:   OPTIONAL: (only used for smith-wilson): ultimate forward 
                             rate (default: last liquid point)
@item @var{alpha}: OPTIONAL: (only used for smith-wilson): reversion speed 
                             to ultimate forward rate (default: 0.1)
@item @var{method_extrapolation}: OPTIONAL: extrapolation method
@item @var{y}: OUTPUT: inter/extrapolated rate

Compute the prices of European Binary call or put options according to 
Reiner and Rubinstein (Unscrambling the Binary Code, RISK 4 (October 1991), 
pp. 75-83)  valuation formulas:@*
@*
Option type Gap@*
A gap call option pays the difference (gap) between spot and either one of two
strike values:
@example
@group
C(S,X1,X2,T) = X2*exp(-rT)*N(d)
P(S,X1,X2,T) = X2*exp(-rT)*N(-d)
d = (log(S/X1) + (r - divrate + 0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*sqrt(T))
@end group
@end example
@*
Option type Cash-or-Nothing@*
A cash or nothing option pays the pre-defined amount X2 if the value is larger
than the strike X1 (call option) or lower than the strike X1(put option):
@example
@group
C(S,X1,X2,T) = N(d)*X2*exp(-rT)
P(S,X1,X2,T) = N(-d)*X2*exp(-rT)
d = (log(S/X1) + (r - divrate - 0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*sqrt(T))
@end group
@end example
@*
Option type Asset-or-Nothing@*
An asset or nothing option pays the future spot value S if the value is larger
than the strike X1(call option) or lower than the strike X1 (put option):
@example
@group
C(S,X1,T) = S*N(d)*exp(-divrate*T)
P(S,X1,T) = S*N(-d)*exp(-divrate*T)
d = (log(S/X1) + (r - divrate + 0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*sqrt(T))
@end group
@end example
@*
Option type Supershare@*
A supershare option has a payoff, if the future spot values lies between
an lower bound X1 and upper bound X2, and is zero otherwise:
@example
@group
Value(S,X1,X2,T) = (S*exp(-divrate*T)/X1) * (N(d1) - N(d2))
d1 = (log(S/X1) + (r - divrate + 0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*sqrt(T))
d2 = (log(S/X2) + (r - divrate + 0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*sqrt(T))
@end group
@end example
@*

Compute the prices of European Lookback call or put options of type
floating strike or fixed strike.@*
@*
Floating Strike options:@*
A floating strike lookback call / put gives you the right to buy / sell the
the underlying security at the lowest / highest price observed during options
lifetime. Pricing according to Goldman, Sosin and Gatto (1979) ("Path dependent
options: Buy at the Low Sell at the High", Journal of Finance, 34(5), 1111-
1127) valuation formulas.@*
@*
Fixed Strike options:@*
A fixed strike lookback call / put pays out the maximum of the difference 
between the highed observed price and the strike and 0 (call option) or the maximum
of the difference between strike and lowest observed price and 0 (put option).
Pricing according to Conze and Viswanathan (1991) ("Path dependent

Computes the price of european or american equity options according to the 
willow tree model.@*
The willow tree approach provides a fast and accurate way of calculating 
option prices. 
This implementation of the willow tree concept is based on following
literature:
@itemize @bullet
@item 'Willow Tree', Andy C.T. Ho, Master thesis, May 2000
@item 'Willow Power: Optimizing Derivative Pricing Trees', Michael Curran, 
ALGO RESEARCH QUARTERLY, Vol. 4, No. 4, December 2001

Example of an American Call Option with continuous dividends:@*
(365 days to maturity, vector with different spot prices and volatilities, 
strike = 8, r = 0.06, dividend = 0.05, timestep 5 days, 20 nodes):

Variables:
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{CallPutFlag}: Call: '1', Put: '0'
@item @var{AmericanFlag}: American option: '1', European Option: '0'
@item @var{S}: stock price at time 0
@item @var{X}: strike price 
@item @var{T}: time in days to maturity
@item @var{r}: annual risk-free interest rate (cont, act/365)
@item @var{sigma}: implied volatility of the stock price
@item @var{dividend}: continuous dividend yield, act/365
@item @var{dk}: size of timesteps for valuation points (default: 5 days)
@item @var{nodes}: number of nodes for willow tree setup. 
Number of nodes must be in list [10,15,20,30,40,50]. These vectors are 
optimized by Currans Method to fulfill variance constraint (default: 20)
@item @var{path_static}: Optional: path to static files

Perform integration tests for all functions which rely on input and output 
data. The functions have to be hard coded in this script and rely on validated
output data. The storage and parsing process of objects is a little bit tricky.
At first, all objects have to converted into structed and stored to a file.
After the structs from the file have been parsed, all structe have to
converted back again into objects using constructor and set methods.
See section B.2 for an example.

@c The following macro marks words that aspell should ignore during
@c spellchecking.  Within Texinfo it has no effect as it merely replaces
@c the macro call with the argument itself.

@macro nospell {arg}
\arg\
@end macro

@c The following macro works around the Info/plain text expansion of @code{XXX}
@c which is `XXX'.  This looks particularly bad when the macro body is
@c single or double-quoted text, such as a property value `"position"'
@ifinfo
@macro qcode{arg}
\arg\
@end macro
@end ifinfo
@ifnotinfo
@macro qcode{arg}
@code{\arg\}
@end macro
@end ifnotinfo

@c The following macro is used for the on-line help system, but we don't
@c want lots of `See also: foo, bar, and baz' strings cluttering the
@c printed manual (that information should be in the supporting text for
@c each group of functions and variables).
@c
@c Implementation Note:
@c For TeX, @vskip produces a nice separation.
@c For Texinfo, '@sp 1' should work, but in practice produces ugly results
@c for HTML.  We use a simple blank line to produce the correct behavior.

@macro seealso {args}
@iftex
@vskip 2pt
@end iftex
@ifnottex

@end ifnottex
@ifnotinfo
@noindent
@strong{See also:} \args\.

@c The following macro works around a situation where the Info/plain text
@c expansion of the @code{XXX} macro is `XXX'.  The use of the apostrophe
@c can be confusing if the code segment itself ends with a transpose operator.
@ifinfo
@macro tcode{arg}
\arg\
@end macro
@end ifinfo
@ifnotinfo
@macro tcode{arg}
@code{\arg\}
@end macro
@end ifnotinfo

@c FIXME: someday, when Texinfo 5.X is standard, we might replace this with
@c @backslashchar, which is a new addition to Texinfo.

@macro xbackslashchar

@end macro

@c These may be useful for all, not just for octave.texi.

Compute the put or call value of different equity options.

This function should be called from Option class
which handles all input and ouput data.

Input and output variables:
@itemize @bullet
@item @var{option_type}: Integer: Sets pricing engine (1=EU(BS),2=AM(CRR),3=ASIAN ARITHMETIC(MC))
@item @var{call_flag}: Boolean: (true: call option, false: put option
@item @var{S_vec}: Double: Spot prices (either scalar or vector of length m)
@item @var{X_vec}: Double: Strike prices (either scalar or vector of length m)
@item @var{T_vec}: Double: Time to maturity (days, act/365) (either scalar or vector of length m)
@item @var{r_vec}: Double: riskfree rate (either scalar or vector of length m)
@item @var{sigma_vec}: Double: volatility (annualized,act/365) (either scalar or vector of length m)
@item @var{divrate_vec}: Double: dividend yield (cont,act/365) (either scalar or vector of length m)
@item @var{n}: Integer: number of tree steps (AM) or number of MC scenarios (ASIAN)
@item @var{OptionVec}: Double: OUTPUT: Option prices (columnn vector)
